Split the INPUT text below into sections so that each section contains exactly one key idea. 
For each key idea, provide: 
(a) a short summary of the idea,
(b) the original text section from which the idea was extracted.

Respond with a json file containing an array of objects, one for each key idea, with the following fields:
- "chunk": the summary of the key idea
- "original_text": the original text section from which the idea was extracted

Respond only with a json file, nothing else.

Make sure that the original_text pieces are exactly the same as in the INPUT text below, including the punctuation.
