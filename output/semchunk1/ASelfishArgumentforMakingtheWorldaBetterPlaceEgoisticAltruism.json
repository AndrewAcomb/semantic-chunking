{"file": "raw_text/ASelfishArgumentforMakingtheWorldaBetterPlaceEgoisticAltruism.txt", "original": " Until recently, the vast majority of the world population worked on farms and the total production of the world's economy was mostly the total agricultural output. And this output was limited by the fixed size of the land. The total output of the economy did not change a lot year by year. The size of the pie was fixed. The world was a zero-sum game. In such a stagnating world, the only way to get better off is if someone else gets worse off. If you take a bigger piece of the pie, someone else is get smaller. If you want more food, then conquering, plundering and stealing our great strategies, your neighbors' loss is your gain. This was the state of things for thousands of years. Society has invaded each other constantly to get more pie. Economic inequality was extreme. Some had all the pie they wanted while others had to live with the crumbs. Then the industrial revolution happened and everything changed. We developed machinery, better crops, better fertilizers, agricultural output skyrocketed. But we didn't just produce more food, every industrial sector exploded in terms of productivity. From 1700 to 1870, the production of iron in Britain increased 137fold. The industrial revolution led to a previously unimaginable increase in economic output. This altered the nature of our societies. Economic growth changed the world from a zero-sum game to a positive sum game. We had found a way to create a bigger pie. Not only a bigger pie, but a pie that was growing bigger each year. What people could have more at the same time. This development is spreading and continuing today. Antibiotics kill bacteria, hard plants to live energy, cell phones, connectors, planes, letters travel cheaply, fridges, stall food. Continuous progress in all sectors of the economy seems normal to us today. But the change from stagnation to economic growth really was the most drastic shift in human history. How was this possible? At the very core of this massive transformation, stand new ideas that lead to innovation. Innovation has many different definitions. But in the context of this video, we mean better solutions to existing problems and solutions to problems we didn't know we had. The more you innovate, the more complex and interesting problems you discover as your wishes and needs evolve. The average citizen in Norway 250 years ago might have wanted some really good shoes. 150 years ago, maybe a bicycle, 80 years ago, a car, 30 years ago, cheap air travel. And so on. Once we get what we want, we don't stop. We can see how we can improve things even more and how to make things even better. The new positive some world has existed for 0.1% of human history and we have yet to get used to it. It's a consequence that feels really unintuitive. In a positive some world, it's in your personal selfish, best interest that every human on planet Earth is well off. It's good for you if people in obscure parts of countries you've never heard of of prospering. There is a genuine selfish argument for making the world a better place. In a positive some world, the more people are well off, the better your own life is. This is because of the nature of innovation. It is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. The supply increases when more people have the freedom and education to contribute. They become inventors, researchers, engineers or thinkers that come up with new ideas. The demand for ideas increases as people get richer and can pay for new solutions. They increase the size of the market for innovations. Innovation follows incentives. So naturally if many people want and can pay for something, it will get the innovators' attention and energy. Improving the lives of those who are worse off has a multiplying effect. It increases demand for ideas while at the same time making it easier for ideas to be produced. Let's take an example that interests all of us a cure for cancer. If there are 1 billion people in the world that have the wealth to pay for cancer treatments, innovation will follow this demand. So hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in medical research. This had a huge effect but we still know where near to curing all forms of cancer. Today every sixth person in the world dies of cancer and you might be one of them. Now imagine if demand were higher. Imagine instead of 1 billion people being able to pay for a cure for cancer, there were 4 billion or 7 billion. Imagine how far medicine could have developed if we'd invested 7 times as much in curing cancer. On top of that, there's so much human potential being wasted right now. The work of a poor farmer in a developing nation is not useful to you, but if he becomes better off, his children might spend their time in the university developing things that are useful to you. Instead of having some hotspots of innovation in the developed world, we would have many hotspots all over the world. The research output of humanity would be many times what it is right now. Could we have cured cancer by now if that were the case? Well maybe, if we spent 7 times as much on research, had 7 times as many people working on it and a global network of medical research, things would certainly be further ahead than they are now. And this is the core of the argument. The more people want the same thing that you want, the more likely you are to get it. That is what it means to live in a positive some world. You don't gain more pif or places staple. Instead, you get more pif or places get richer, contribute ideas and grow the global pif. But you like space travel? Imagine there were billions of people in Africa and Asia with their own space programs and demand for satellites and moon bases and cities on Mars. Do you like being alive? A few billion people paying for medical research could literally save your life. It's in your interest for people around the world to become better off. The faster we get to this version of the world, the better for you personally. No matter what your motivation is, working on a better world is a very good thing to do. For others, and for you.
