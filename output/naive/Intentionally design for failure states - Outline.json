    "original": "- # [[example]]s of how games deal with failure states in many different ways\n    - ## Some games make failure incredibly punishing, but give the player a chance at redemption.\n        - # [[example]] of Hollow Knight and [[streak counter]]s.\n            - In a streak counter in a meditation or fitness app you count the number of days in a row that you do an activity, and you experience failure when you lose a streak.\n                - These \"work\" based on:\n                    - [[endowment effect]]\n                        - The more days people have built into their streaks, the more of a sense of ownership they take over it, making the streak more valuable to maintain.\n                    - [[loss aversion]]\n                        - People really dislike losing something they value, so they'll work extra hard to maintain the streak.\n                - Streak counters are only really motivating while you have a streak going. In the early stages of a streak, it is not valuable so people don't mind losing them.  Upon losing a long streak, [[loss aversion]] leads to a significant feeling of distress.  This can demoralize the user, especially if it will take weeks, months, or longer to recover the streak.\n            - In [[Hollow Knight]], they wanted to make a challenging game because they wanted players to feel the accomplishment of beating something that previously beat them.\n                - So you\u2019re exploring around this map, killing monsters, earning money.\n                    - When you die, you lose all of your money, and go back to your last checkpoint.\n                        - Sounds super demotivating, right?  Well, the same thing is basically happening in a streak counter.  You work up days in a row, and then upon failure, you have to start over again.  Sound similar in structure?\n                            - **Hollow Knight** does something clever to deal with this.  When you die, you leave a \u201cshade\u201d where you died, lose all of your money, and go back to your last checkpoint.  In order to get all of your money back, you need to get to the shade and beat it.  If you die again before then, then you lose all the money for good.\n                                - ^^Dark Souls game designers wanted players to try again after failing. In order to encourage that behavior, they gave players something to lose from failing and a chance to regain it all from trying again to get to the point where they lost everything.^^\n    - ## In some games, the failure state is not punishing.\n        - This happens in two main types of games:\n            - The game is very challenging, so the player will fail often.\n                - [[example]]: Celeste is an extremely hard game.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to die a lot, so failure is made non-punishing and the end is generally in sight so you don\u2019t get frustrated.\u00a0 It\u2019s expected that each life is not gonna last very long.  Repeated failure is the game designers attempt to clearly communicate what went wrong to the player so they can adjust their behavior and become better at the game.\n                    - In this screenshot, when the player lands on the rectangular platform, the platform will move quickly on the gears and if they jump they'll go flying into the spikes.  They learn pretty quickly that momentum is conserved and that they should wait until the platform stops moving.\n                        - [[screenshot]] of Celeste failure ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRob-Haisfield-Thinking-in-Public%2FTzlKnbU2Dz?alt=media&token=349df1d2-5241-4f2f-839c-507a037a7180).\n                        - [[screenshot]] of Celeste growth mindset ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRob-Haisfield-Thinking-in-Public%2FpEQ3-ALRnq?alt=media&token=760432cd-65b6-4120-8a07-72ac0b391193).\n            - Failure is also made non-punishing for games that are meant to be easy.\n    - ## Some games challenge you to make it further next time.\n        - Roguelike games generally have a few common principles:\n            - Every time you die, you start over at the beginning of the game.\n            - During each life, you engage in a \"run,\" where you attempt to make it further than you made it last time.\n            - Each run is similar but with randomized elements so you have a unique experience each time.\n    - ## Some games reward failure, giving you a boost in your next life.\n        - ### [[example]] Ziggurat is a [[roguelike]] game.\n            - During each run, the player attempts to make it further than they did before. The further they make it, the better power ups they earn.  However, the player isn't able to use the power ups until their next run, which means that they need to fail first and they may actually look forward to failure.\n                - [[screenshot]] of Ziggurat ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRob-Haisfield-Thinking-in-Public%2Ff91VECu9ky?alt=media&token=77778221-7291-46a0-b85f-511102c3593d).\n        - [[example]] [[failure state in Dead Cells]].\n            - Some games reward failure, giving you a boost in your next life.\n                - During each run, you're killing monsters and collecting money.  When you die, it actually allows you to use some of the money that you had left when you died on your next run, making you feel as though you have already started and helping you move past the part at the beginning that you've done a thousand times more quickly [[goal gradient effect]].\n                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRob-Haisfield-Thinking-in-Public%2FN5rstKoXaR.png?alt=media&token=c3f11f3e-8a4f-4902-a6eb-fe3bdd8fb4a5) [[screenshot]] of Dead Cells.\n        - ### [[example]] Sundered is a metroidvania game where dying is your only opportunity to access a shop with upgrades.
