    "original": " The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, a just 0.1% of the speed of light, it could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the Milky Way has existed, so in principle any space-faring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing. Here nothing. The Universe seems empty, devoid of others. This is the Family Paradox which we've discussed in more detail in other videos. Confronted with the seemingly empty Universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to cool out and reveal ourselves to anyone watching, but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the Universe is not empty. Maybe it's full of civilizations, but they are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations that attracted attention in the past were weren't to weigh by invisible arrows. This is the Dark Forest solution to the Fermi Paradox. The Way of Life. The Hunter awaits in his hiding place, and carefully listens for suspicious noises from the thick underground before he gets up. Another light has passed without incident. The forest is dark and full of fog. He considers calling out to others to end his loneliness, but stops himself for the last moment. What if they are like him? All living things seek to survive secure resources and multiply. Their greatest obstacle are other living things that share the same objective. Competition between species favored the survival of beings with advantageous traits. Our ancestors were inventive, competitive, expansionist and greedy for resources, which led them to winning the competition for our planet. Today, most other animals are so utterly at our mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species a day, just as an unintentional byproduct of how we like to ramp things. But humans are more than individuals. From us, cultures emerge that also compete with each other. Competitive and expansionary cultures spread faster and further, and merge with subdued or destroy others. If we look at our history, it becomes clear. We are dangerous. Not just to others, but also to ourselves. Our human nature has driven us to take over every corner of our planet, and soon we will look to the stars, both to expand our domain, and ensure access to ever more resources. And then we might stumble upon others trying to do the same thing. It's likely that the competition of life also takes place on far away planet. So it's logical to assume that an alien civilization that came to dominate their planet would be in some regards similar to us, but if they're similar to us, they too may be dangerous. The implication As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest all alone, he knows that there might be others like him. He can't know their intentions if they are aggressive or not. The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his own survival, so he has to assume that they would too. And it might be that if he stumbles upon another hunter, the one that shoots first survives. None of this means that conflict is unavoidable. So far the progress of the modern world seems to have made us more peaceful, not more violent. Maybe this is true for other civilizations too, that eventually progress means less conflict, not more. Different alien civilizations also should vary from the mild and peaceful to the malevolent and militaristic. The existential problem we're facing is that when we meet others, between the stars, we have no way of telling who is peaceful or aggressive and what their true intentions are. Similarly, they might not understand or trust our intentions, even if we tell them that we are peaceful. On top of that, if we did discover another civilization and they discovered us, the light years between us would mean years of communication delay. Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty, wondering if the wisest move is to just attack, because there's another serious issue, technological explosions, and the first strike advantage. We don't know whether limits of technology are, but we do know how much technological progress matters in war. A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict with uncertain results into a one-sided massacre. Seasers' legions would stand no chance against Napoleon's army with their cannons and muskets, which would be eradicated by artillery from the First World War, which would not stand a chance against today's drones and guided missiles. So the power level of different civilizations may very massively, and even if not, between the time it takes us to detect another civilization and us saying, hi, we might already be hopelessly behind on the tech tree. Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar conflict makes this worse. If your opponent is likely it's a way, sending an invasion of feats takes so long that by the time it arrives, it might be hopelessly obsolete. So war between civilizations might be just about eliminating the other to remove an existential threat to yourself. Someone else who might be so scared of you, that they attack the First Chance they get. In this environment, the only way to guarantee a win is to strike with such force and speed that the target has no chance of survival or time to counter attack or escape to seek revenge later. The stakes are the highest possible with no run for error. If we assume that the majority of civilizations live on planets, that leaves them pretty vulnerable. All you need to do is throw something massive at a planet to make it uninhabitable. So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation weapon is probably something like a relativistic kill vehicle. A missile shot at a planet at a significant fraction of the suite of light. For example, a missile the size of the person going 95% the speed of light has as much energy as all nuclear bombs on Earth. If you shot a few dozen of the civilization you wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly certain, even a single hit would suffice. This is not that absurd of an idea. A civilization only slightly above us on the Kardishef scale would have enough energy to send multiple strikes against every planet it's a specks of harbouring life. What makes these weapons so sinister is how much they favor a first strike since they would be so fast that it might be impossible to protect yourself effectively against them once they're launched. Conflict between civilizations may not be lengthy affairs but rapid winner takes all situations, with the first one to shoot with. This makes any civilization an existential threat to any other. And if every civilization is an existential threat to every other, there may be only two kinds of civilizations out there. Quiet ones and dead ones. So what should we do? Should we worry? It's unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity yet. The radio signals we've transmitted in the last 100 years travelled a relatively tiny distance and have long decayed into unreadable noise. At our technological stage, if we don't actively try to get noticed and if nobody specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable solar system, we'll stay hidden. But one day we will venture into space in a serious way and need to consider these kinds of questions again. We don't know if there are others or if we are going through the forest alone but we have no way of knowing for sure. For the time being, it seems the best we can do is to carefully listen. And even if we see others step into a clearing and make themselves known, we should not reply right away, but carefully watch them from the underground. Perhaps we are also thinking about this all wrong by allowing our primitive brain that evolved in the context of the gruesome competition of life to conjure fears of predatory aliens all around us. Maybe the fact that we are looking at the universe like this is a sign that we are not grown up yet as a species. There could be a friendly welcoming community of alien civilizations waiting to hear from us when we are ready. As for now, the good news is there is actually little we need to do. We just need to be thoughtful about the signals we send out into the galaxy we need to watch the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our forest. Because whatever the nature of our forest is, full of dangers or friends or nobody at all, only careful observation can tell. So, let's do that. At last, the hunter reaches a clearing and finds a comfortable position. Slowly, the sun melts the fog away. Lost in thought, he admires the vegetation until suddenly, he is eye to eye with another hunter, frozen in terror, just like himself. His mind is racing, considering all the different options. The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a decision. Maybe the only way out of the dark forest is to step into the clearing together. And with this hopeful picture, we say goodbye to the year 1221 of the human era. It was a while to say the least, still much more fun than 1220. Cronccs are headed most successful month ever and published a book. We tried a lot of new techniques and ready got into blender and cinema 40, hiding more and more 3D in our videos. We have so many ideas for next year and big and ambitious plans that we can't wait to share with you. And all of this was and is possible because of your direct support. Thank you so much. Cotskazar to only works because of you. So, in tune with the end of the year, we've designed a few products that will help you to visualize your place in the universe. Our very shiny, the night sky poster shows you the little piece of space we can see from Earth with our own eyes, or travel further out with our stellar zoom collection that depicts our home in space for an increasing distance. Or dream with our space themed notebooks, scenic posters and pens. We design and produce every single product with great care. Getting something from our shop is the best way to support Cotskazar. We hope you have a wonderful end of the year and the 2022 is more fun and less exciting than the last two years. Thank you for watching.",
