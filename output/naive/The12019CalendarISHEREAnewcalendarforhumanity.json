    "original": " It's the most wonderful time of the year again. The 12,000 and 19 human era calendar is out. Go get our new limited edition now or regret it forever. We heard your comments on last year's edition, so we've updated the design. Each illustration is now featured on a full page with so much more space to take notes below. Exactly 2.366, 8,9 times as much as in the old layout. So the calendar has a spiral binding, shiny silver letters on the cover, and is printed on high-quality paper that's nice to touch. The calendar looks awesome on your wall, but it's also the easiest way to tick off your whole present list for Christmas. If you're there now, it will arrive before the holidays and it's the perfect gift for your friends, kids, grandma, doggo, mortal enemies or random strangers you meet on the straight. On the inside you find 12, brand new beautiful illustrations of early human cultures and craftsmanship prior to the first civilizations in the use of metal. This topic is endlessly fascinating to us. Our ancestors' achievements from 10,000 years ago paved the way from modern civilization, so we can only dream of what might be possible in the future through human cooperation. By the way, if you're wondering about the date, we explained why 2019 should be our current year in our a new calendar for humanity video. Audio calendar now, it will be available as a limited edition until our stock is sold out and then never again. The human calendar is a super fun side project we got to do for the third time thanks to your support. We loved getting males, tweets and pictures with your calendars from over 80 countries last year, so we're already looking forward to all your messages.",
