    "original": " Everything changed when the slave nation attacked. What used to be a thriving colony is now a captured country. Slaves do the work, serving their new masters until they die, only to be replaced by new victims harvested in brutal raids. But let's go back to the beginning. The World War of the Ants is claiming millions of lives every day. But in the brutal world of ants, straight out war is not the only way. Around 50 Ants species, practice and slavery, the most extreme division of labour. We don't know how this began, but some Ants species perfected this cruel trade. Meet Polyone. The most intense of the slavre and tribes. There are different species, but generally there are 4 to 10mm long, with round to blackish bodies and sickle-shaped mandibles. Polyergus has specialized in slavery so much that they've lost their ability to care for themselves. They don't clean, build nests, care for their brood, or feed themselves. They only exist for raiding. Slaves make up 82% of the ants in their colonies, so a few hundred polyergus and a single queen control thousands of slave ants. We'll summarize and simplify what we know about polyergus into one grand story. You can find more information in our sources. So now, let's witness the cruel banality of nature. The rate. It all begins on a mild summer morning on a sunny field. Witness this colony over 10,000 formic ants, genetically cousins of polyergus, who build a thriving nest underground. They are a widespread genus, so species are good fighters, some great builders, and some cattle farmers, often welcomed by humans because they hunt vermin that hurt forests. Nobody noticed the lone polyergus scout that briefly showed up this morning before she bolted away again. The attack begins in the early afternoon. The scout returned from her mission to find the former colonists. She dances erratically and spreads furrimones that excite and mass recruit more and more ants, until a large raiding party of a thousand warrior ss has formed. A close pact well organised column up to 10 meters long begins to move. As the polyergus raiding party arrives at the former colony, the attack begins almost immediately. Dusns of attackers begin digging and clearing up debris from an air stentrance to make it easier to stall. As soon as they're done, hundreds of attackers rush inside. The defenders vastly outnumber their attackers, and are formidable warriors able to shoot at it. But instead of fighting back effectively, they seem confused and scatter rather than fighting back. Polyergus also seems to be somewhat resistant to the acid sprays of the defenders, and so even if a defense is forming, the attackers use their mandibles to pierce and kill. There are a few different ideas as to why polyergus attacks are so efficient, and one of the most fascinating ones is chemical warfare. Instead of relying on brute force, they release a propaganda ceremony that makes the defenders panic, unable to mount an organised defense. The attackers have nothing to gain from intense and to uncombatte other than immense casualties. What's more, they actually want their victims to survive so that they can be rated again in a few weeks. As the raid unfolds, the attackers breach deep into the colony, looking for their most valuable possession, the colonist babies. They grab the pupae and larvae that will make up the next generation of formica and carry them out of the nest. Hundreds are abducted and brought back to the polyergus colony in this raid alone. Well, most of them, a few unlucky ones are eaten as a sort of snack. The surviving victims will be turned into slaves. After about an hour, the raid is over, and the formica can begin to recover. It seems their only strategy is to make even more ants. A decent sized colony can form fit thousands of pupae in a single raiding season and still survive. Although in this case, while the raid was going on, something even more sinister happened. Hold that thought, though, because how are polyergus turning ants into slaves? How to brainwash ants slaves? Ants conquered almost the entire planet over 100 million years ago. They owe their success to being social animals that perfected chemical communication. Chemical signals and cues let ants know what their colony needs and what each individual should do. And most importantly, in this case, who is a friend or foe. Slave making ants are much less social than other ant species. Some species miss a lot of the genes other ants have to make communication possible. In a sense, they are bad at talking to each other. So it may be that as polyergus ants have started to abduct other ants, they lost the ability to collaborate and work together productively. Soon after the stodin four-micar offspring have been brought to the Slave of Colony, they are progressively covered in polyergus' pharaohs. They are chemically imprinted, similar to a duckling, who imprints on its mother after birth. When the new slaves hatched, they behave as though they are part of the polyergus colony and begin to work for them unconditionally, keeping the nest clean, caring for the next generation of slaves and masters, hunting for food and feeding their enslave as mouth to mouth. This sort of brainwashing goes so far that if they encounter free formic ants in the world, they will treat them as animals. In a sense, they are not true slaves as they serve willingly and show no interest in freedom. It's more like violent, abduction and adoption, which doesn't make things that much better. And as the four-micar only live for a few months, a constant new supply of victims is necessary. Two survive, polyergus can never stop in Slavey. How to make new slave colonies? How are new polyergus colonies created? After all, polyergus workers are so useless that a queen can't start a new colony without slaves. But how does she make slaves without warriors? It turns out there are two main strategies. The more dangerous one might unfold during a raid like the one we witnessed before. A young polyergus queen silently follows the raiding party. Using the chaos of the invasion, she's able to find her way to the four-micar queen and kill her, taking over the second colony. Although, such a victory may be very short-nifths. Polyergus do not tolerate other slave colonies within their hunting ground. They raided each other firstly too, and can destroy the competing colonies nearby. So while those tactics sometimes works, it is pretty dangerous. Another young queen is going for a different strategy. She's looking for a four-micar colony that is further from her birthplace, attacking a whole colony on her own. She bolts through an entrance, pushing aside confused ants that try to stop her, releasing a powerful appeasement ceremony that drives defenders away. She has only a short time window to find the four-micar queen deep in the hostile nest. Once she finds her target, both queens engage in a fight to the death. The polyergus queen is well equipped with her sharp mandibles. She bites and rips into her victim for about half an hour before she finally comes down. Between her bite, she licks the chemical surface of the dead four-micar queen, covering herself in her fair modes. When she's done with this macarbra ritual, four-micar workers approach her. Subdued by her intense smells, they start grooming and feeding her as though pledging their allegiance to their new ruler. She still might not be done though. For macar colonies often have multiple queens who all need to be defeated, which is not guaranteed. Often, attacking queens will be stopped by a phallence of workers that rip her apart or are defeated in raw battle. But if she does manage to kill all the queens, the colony has been taken over and the enslaved brood will begin to serve a new queen. The Eusepper. She now begins laying eggs that are cared for by her new slaves until new polyergus ants hatched, that will soon start new raids on neighbouring colonies. No matter what we humans do, quietly below our feet, the world war of the ants is raging, with wild and horrible strategies fought by billions of individuals every single day. Polyergus will continue to hunt for slaves as to stop raiding would be their demise. And in the war of the ants, there is no giving up. We want to explore even more ant species in videos to come, but not just ants, our planet has so many more wonders to marvel at and learn about. That is, if we manage to preserve their habitat and turn the tide on climate change, something we're very passionate about at Cotskazart and have covered extensively in past videos. We've found a partner to turn our dedication into action. We'll pay to offset one month of your carbon emissions, with the help of our friends from Ren.
