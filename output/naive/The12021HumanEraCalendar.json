    "original": " For the fifth time we present to you the Human Air Canada for the year 1221. This time it's all about the journey of humanity. Beginning tens of thousands of years ago, leading into the revolution of agriculture, to ancient high civilizations and the beginning of modern times, culminating in a vision for our future. You can get the limited edition now until we set out and then never again. As always the Canada features 12 illustrated pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the U.S. And this year the cover is especially shiny. Not only does the Canada look great on walls and mix it easier to dream about a glorious future and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support Kotkazak. The calendar enables us to put in the time-ar videos need and release them for free for everyone. If you want you can get the Canada with a hoodie or infographic posters or plushie, we've made a few deals for you. Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the Canada every year and to the Burbs who love what we try to do on this channel. We wish you a happy year 2021 and that's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,000 and 20.",
