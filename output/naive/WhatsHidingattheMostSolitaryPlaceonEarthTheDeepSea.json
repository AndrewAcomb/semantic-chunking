    "original": " Sometimes the world feels, hmm, boring. We've visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles. But there is still one place to explore. It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures, living in total darkness. The deep sea. Let's dive down. When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans, it's hard to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on Earth lives here. And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first 200 meters. This is where we begin our journey. Here light can still penetrate the water, which allows photosynthesis to occur. Fyto-Pountain, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae in bacteria make up the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who are consumed by other species. The sea floor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with coral reefs, algae, and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals. So far we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment, where we fish, swim, pollute and do science. So, let's dive deeper. Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper and more remote waters, we eventually reach the edge of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope, the longer sent down to the deep sea. With every additional meter of water light fades drastically, which means there are basically no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope, begins to remind us of the surface of the moon. Looking out where faced by what seems to be endless open water. Let's leave the slope by-dust and enter what's known as the twilight zone, the portal to the deep sea. As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels. The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters. At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you. Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey. While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals actually spend at least half their lives down here. During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the vast dark waters. At night, they can travel more safely into shallow zones to feed in the food-rich surface waters. In this transition zone between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool. Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use bio-luminacense chemicals to create night. They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight to send signals to potential mates or to confuse and scare attackers. Or they use light to hunt. Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork. At around 700 meters, we encounter a colony of ciphonophores. They can be up to 50 meters in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick. To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light and applies a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles the kill anything that comes to close. But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource, marines snow. White, flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It consists of dead plant or animal parts, fico matter, shells, sand or dust. Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the deep sea would starve. It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could happen. Spurm whales hunt and attack a giant squid the size of a house. While the squid fight back for roachously, they probably don't stand a chance, but they do leave permanent marks on their killer skin. As we reach 1000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful. This is the midnight zone, a place of utter darkness. A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black and open water. These depths is harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space. Finding food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt to and become extremely energy efficient. Like the 30 centimeter long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion, with long and slender catching arms extended, they're covered in tiny stiff hairs which brush food from the water. This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food. For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food since living prey is quite rare down here. So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike, otherwise it will escape into the dark. Many deep sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth. Like the Viperfish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole. All the frill shark with its impressive set of 300 teeth which are curved backwards to hook their victims in their mouths. We think further below the 3,800 mark as deep as the grave of the Titanic. We are now at the Bissel Deds. Here life happens in slow motion. Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival. Everything down here, hovers motionless or swims in a slow, elegant fashion. The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger. Like the Dumbo Octopot paddling with its ear like fins or the Grenadiers fish with its slow, ear like tailbeats. At 4,000 meters we finally reach Grand Again, the Abyssal plane. It's covered in grey, modern rocks, dusted with the remains of the rain snow, which is consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins and sea worms. In some regions of the sea floor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen. These are Manganese nodules. Deep sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea. Though life is sparse on the deep sea floor, even down here there are Oasis. In the Rift Valley's where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up sea water and creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400 degrees Celsius that form elaborate chimneys and towers. Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the basis for unique ecosystems. As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the Abyssal plane at 6000 meters. For most of the sea floor, this is as deep as it gets. But if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans, we're actually only halfway there. Let's enter the Hateful Zone, the Underworld of the Sea. It consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans and are among the most extreme environments on Earth. Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish that holds the record for the deepest living fish ever seen at around 8,000 meters. We see Spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000. Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana trench with gently sloping sides that in frame of valley about 1.6 km wide. This is it, the deepest point, the Challenger Deep, 11,000 meters below the surface. The water pressure here is 1,086 bar. Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1,800 elephants on top of you. But even here, life has found a way to thrive. Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphibods wiggle their way through the water. Their size is astounding. While their shallow water cousins and media few centimeters long, the deep sea version can reach up to 30 centimeters. And there are other things floating elegantly through the water. Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018. Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence. There's nothing left to do now and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our set. After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light. We arrive back at a calm surface. The oceans are so deep, there is so much of them. We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we can. There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered. So you're all tingly now and want to go exploring. Why not start off with some juicy science?
