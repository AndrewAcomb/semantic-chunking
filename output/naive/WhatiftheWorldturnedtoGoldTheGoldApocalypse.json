    "original": " Here in the Cotskzak Labs we only work on the most important scientific problems like what if we knew stuff or how about we make this elephant explode or who could forget look at this thing it's really big. Continuing this Proud tradition let's explore the scientific mystery of what would happen to you if Earth suddenly turned into gold. The Midas Pogleps based on the ancient tale of King Midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold. Before we can explore this scenario with science we'll first define the prowess. Midas' curse is a very special phenomenon called magic which allows us to modify physics. So what happens when Midas touches something and it turns to gold? An atom of gold has 79 protons and 118 neutrons in its nucleus. The electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom and gives gold its chemical properties like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and bending. So to make not gold into gold we have to change atoms. Let's say Midas touches a duck. All the light elements like hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, gain electrons and protons and neutrons to become gold. Not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive it's also much too dense. The gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repeat each other violently causing the golden duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of TNT leaving only gold dust and a very dead Midas. This is clearly not a very good way for Midas' power to work. So what if instead Midas' power uses the atom that are already present and simply rearranges all particles in the matter he touches into gold? No matter is created or destroyed instead atoms dissolve and the protons, neutrons and electrons are reassembled to make gold. However gold is very dense about 20 times denser than a duck. Without adding any matter the gold duck would be a very awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps. This is funky and doesn't explode which is progress. Now that we've established a sort of magic that works what would happen if Midas stumbles. What if he touches earth itself? Let's freeze time for just a moment and rearrange all the matter in the earth. Just like the duck the earth is now solid gold but with many tiny atomic scale gaps. While these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck there are big problem for the earth. A spongy planet is not a thing that can exist as gravity compresses earth squeezing it together as it close up the gaps. As a result the earth contracts shrinking to 2-3rds of its radius. If you're standing on earth's surface you'll suddenly fight yourself in freefall like on a roller coaster as the ground sinks away beneath you. But since the ground is falling too it doesn't move away from you. It feels like someone turned off gravity and you and everything else would begin to float. But the ride doesn't last forever. It takes only 10 minutes for everything to crash down and a weird 10 minutes it is indeed. And then as abruptly as it started it stops the collapsing earth has reached its desired size and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you. Hopefully you enjoyed your minutes of floating because the ground and you with it crash into the planet at 30,000 kilometers now making your body spatter like a water balloon as it hits. In one instant basically all the humanity gets smashed into rent puddles. This is only the start of our problems though since earth imploded superpsonically. The kinetic energy of the implosion is basically equivalent to detonating a planet made of TNT. Crush together under incredible forces Earth's core reaches a million degrees Celsius, a temperature closer to the core of a star than anything we're used to finding on earth. As the earth crashes into itself it generates an enormously powerful shockwave which plows upwards catapulting the atmosphere up and off. The earth's surface temperature reaches hundreds of thousands of degrees and everything on it is instantly vaporised to a fluffy plasma cloud that starts to expand but not by much. Many of the atoms that may have been new get mixed into this cloud while others boil off escaping from the atmosphere. The golden plasma outshines the sun while the enormous radiation lifts tons of material off into space. Over the coming days the plasma cloud cools and eventually freezes into a shiny little golden ball. Okay, maybe this type of magic doesn't work. So if replacing atoms made the earth so overdense that it exploded and disassembling and reassembling atoms made the earth so underdense that it imploded there must be a sweet spot where the earth does neither. What if minus's power is such that an object is suddenly replaced by an object with the same volume made from solid gold? That magic is a little bit more magic and cuts a few extra corners but let's see where this leads us. So, minus stumbles again. Even though our new pure gold earth is not expanding or contracting it's suddenly much more massive. The density of gold is three and a half times greater than the earth. Meaning the earth is going to get three and a half times more massive. For starters everyone now has to contend with surface gravity that is more than three times stronger. So if you're not a champion weightlifter who's used to carrying around a few times your body weight on your shoulders you're probably going to be slammed to the ground by your own weight. Depending on where you were when earth turned into gold this alone could seriously hurt or even kill you. Trees and artificial structures collapse under stress they were never meant to sustain while birds and planes and all things that were able to fly or float, splash to the ground or will round you. And you're not the only thing weighed down by the great gravity. The weight of the atmosphere and also atmospheric pressure nanny quadruples which is a bad thing if you like living. On its own this won't kill you. Scooby-Divers come comfortably breathe air at these pressures for a while but unfortunately squeezing the atmosphere this much raises its temperature to 150 degrees Celsius which is like the insides of an oven. The entire earth surface bakes roasting anything and everything. There is no escape. Gold may be a metal but it's about three times weaker than steel and also very valuable which makes it very bad mountain material. The tallest mountains that can be supported are now only about two kilometres high so whole ranges compress as their own weight basically crushes their base. It's hard to say what happens here. We're probably in for giant earthquakes and landslide as the planet is squeezed into a new shape and it's not just mountain ranges, the differences between the continents and the ocean floor level out causing the ocean basins to overflow sending massive tidal waves over the earth's surface. What remains is a planet made of gold entirely covered by an ocean three kilometres deep a super hot atmosphere and a lot of dead people. Hmm okay there may be a lesson to take away here but we're not sure what it is. We did all the maths though it's in our sources document if you want to take a look. If you learned anything in this video let us know what it was. So as you might know the things we sell in our shop are the reason we're able to publish videos for free but it's way more than that for us. Here's a short story and a making off. A one ago we posted this image on social media just to post something nice looking. Immediately a lot of people were quite upset about it because it was wrong and you guys take what we put out of that seriously. So we deleted it and contacted experts to make something new and better. We spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration and created this new extensive map of evolution. A new visualization of the relationships between living things that didn't exist before. And while this was obviously a lot of work and stress it sort of exemplifies why working on this channel is so satisfying because you people care and this makes us work harder and learn things we didn't know before. So thank you for supporting our crazy ideas and our sometimes crazy merge because of you we can continue to release our videos for free for everyone and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts. We are super grateful for that. You can check out the new evolution poster among many other things made with love in our shop.",
