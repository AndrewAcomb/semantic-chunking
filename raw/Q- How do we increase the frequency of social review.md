A challenge in [[Q- How can people maintain a decentralized discourse graph with a high quantity of information in it|maintaining a decentralized discourse graph with a high quantity of information in it]] is the amount of time required, without a strong incentive system in place. This is an open space to explore.

As [[C- Curation is an important role in maintaining a decentralized discourse graph|curation is an important role in maintaining a decentralized discourse graph]], 
[[Q- How do we increase the frequency of social tagging behaviors|how do we increase the frequency of social tagging behaviors]]?

Challenges also exist because [[C- It is easier for people to cite their own work than the work of others due to limitations of human memory|it is easier for people to cite their own work than the work of others due to limitations of human memory]]. 

Tools like [[Hypothesis]] enable active reading through progressive summarization, which is a constructive behavior in discourse graphs. [[Extended Universe/C- Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis|Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]]. [[C- Synthesis is supported by Active Reading|Synthesis is supported by active reading]].
