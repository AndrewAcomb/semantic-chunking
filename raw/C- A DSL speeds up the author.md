See this example here: doing some relatively common action in a GUI is never going to really get that much faster, whereas in programming, with abstractions and copy-paste, a DSL can get faster. Additionally, if a [[GUI]] requires you to click on things and then type text, it's probably not going to get faster than a textual user interface. https://www.figma.com/file/dTePTU7khNGg53ho1pbH8S/DSL-vs.-GUI-Speed-Comparison?node-id=0%3A1
