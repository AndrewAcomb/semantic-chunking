[[P- Chris Granger]]: Yeah this is something I'm very interested in. Our belief is that we can do it step-wise though. Due to Jump's maleability, we first try to make it something a person can think with and then see what needs to change to support more and more distributed thinking.

[[P- Rob Haisfield]]: Yup, not a bad approach to start with individuals. People will inevitably have their own styles and it'll be interesting to see what emerges. With idiosyncratic styles enabled by an infinitely flexible tool like Jump, it raises theÂ question: how do all of these unique Jump instances come together? You may need to wait and see. I suppose that's just a selection and refactoring question though?
