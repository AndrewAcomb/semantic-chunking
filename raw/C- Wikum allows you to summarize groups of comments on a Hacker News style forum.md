Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]

[[Wikum|Wikum]] is a tool for recursive summarization in internet forums, with an aim to help readers see a summary tree of the main points of discussion. 

This was first published by [[Amy Zhang]], [[Lea Verou]], and [[David Karger]] at CSCW 2017. 

This paper has made significant traction in the para-academic HCI / tools for thought community. 

Example: [[P- Max Krieger]] in [[R- Chatting with Glue]] references [[Wikum|Wikum]], and this piece has made significant waves in this community outside of academic HCI (unclear to me how much impact Krieger's piece has had within academic HCI)

Supports:: [[I- a primitive for composing pages to encapsulate meaning]]

[[C- Retroactive funding incentivizes support because it's easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful in the future]]
