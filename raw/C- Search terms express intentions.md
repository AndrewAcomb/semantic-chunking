This is a big claim in [[R- Everybody Lies]], and is how the author justifies using google search data in order to understand people better.

When users have advanced search options, they are able to specify what they mean. Perhaps when they are searching for PCT, they really mean they are searching for perceptual control theory. A search with an OR clause could communicate that (e.g. `OR: "PCT" "Perecptual Control Theory"`. Then if those searches maintain their permanence, the system could know that I always mean perceptual control theory in that situation.
