Org-roam is a major mod on top of [[Org-mode|Org-mode]], with a goal of creating a Zettelkasten, but finding the vanilla version wasn't enough. Org-roam attempts to replicate [[Roam Research]] in the Org-mode format.

This speaks to the [[Hackers]] culture of modifying tools to fit personal uses, but it's expanded beyond, with over 3800 'stars' on Github as of 2021-09-15.
