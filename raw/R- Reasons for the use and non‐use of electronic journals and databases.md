    - Key ideas:
        - [[paradigmatic relevance]] is an important and distinct notion of relevance (compared to [[Topical Relevance]]) in scholarly information seeking (p. 676)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FU9qtg2BxYc?alt=media&token=70f344e8-d8c9-4ec1-83f3-82f47b57223c)
            - Some kinds of information seeking strategies are better fits for [[paradigmatic relevance]]
                - #Claim Subject headings and keyword searches are more effective for domains with high [[Topical Relevance]]; in domains characterized more by [[paradigmatic relevance]], these stragies are less useful, and other strategies like [[chaining]] or [[Browsing]] are more powerful. (p. 683)

                    - Similar result to [[@bates2002speculations]]'s hypothesized advantage of [[chaining]] in high-[[Scatter]] domains
            - Potentially related to idea of the degree of [[Scatter]] in a domain
        - Tricky to draw boundaries around what we mean by [[Domain]], but it's supposed to be above an individual scholar, and includes some the scholar's [[context]], but more granular than a "field"
        - One interesting finding re: field size (contra [[R: bates2002speculations]])
