[[P- Chris Granger]]: I was thinking about this after our conversation, when you mentioned search being similar to selection and I realized the reason I focused on selection is that search is about showing you places to go whereas selection is about gathering things. They're otherwise the same I think, it's just what the system lets you do with the answer that distinguishes them.

[[P- Rob Haisfield]]: Ah, that clarifies things. Searching, selection, composing, refactoring, copying? Gathering is a good way to frame it. I suppose you have excellent tools for refactoring what you gather as you go and need?
