[[C- A structural editor can make a DSL approachable to end-users]]

[[C- A DSL would let people write in a certain syntax and notation that gets transformed by functions into a data structure that can be manipulated by pre-built or custom-built functions]]

[[C- End user programming enables people to bulk process notes]] and a DSL enables that.

Some examples might include using attributes in Roam to indicate key-value pairs, or [[I- I should be able to leave a hole to fill in the blanks for an idea or domain|being able to leave a hole]] for later input (like in algebra, you figure out what x is in x+3=11 after writing out the equation).
