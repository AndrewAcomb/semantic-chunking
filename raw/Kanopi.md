Kanopi is a multimodal tool for knowledge management that provides different views for thought through linked notes, maps, and trees. Kanopi allows users to define relationships between nodes to create meaning, speaking to the idea of [[I- A structural editor for composing relationships between files or blocks]]. Kanopi has pre-loaded web integrations with Wikidata and Semantic Scholar that appear in search results.  

Solo built by [[P- Brian James Rubinton]].
