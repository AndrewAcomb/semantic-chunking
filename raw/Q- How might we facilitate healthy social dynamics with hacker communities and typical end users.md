Briefly - plugin ecosystems are awesome for end-users insofar as it allows users to create features that the core developers don't have time for. However, the plugin developers will often do this out of the goodness of their heart or out of a personal need for a specific plugin, leaving many users dry, especially if a plugin developer loses the energy or will to maintain the plugin over time. A plugin marketplace is an obvious answer, but this needs to be balanced against a desire not to prevent the community vibes coming from an intrinsically motivated system.
