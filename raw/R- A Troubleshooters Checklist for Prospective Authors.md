        -   Abstract
            -   Presents, in order of frequency of occurrence, critical comments apparent in multiple reviews of 58 manuscripts received from April 1997 to April 1998 by Teaching and Teacher Education, thus identifying the breaches of canon most frequently identified in reviewers' critical comments. There are 13 broad categories of criticism. The one outstanding area of criticism relates to author approach or methodology. (SM)
    -   #[[üìù lit-notes]]
        -   out of 369 criticisms in 142 reviews for 58 manuscripts submitted for review to Teaching and Teacher education, approximately 33% ({{[[calc]]: (31+29+23+21+20)}} / 369) were directly related to inadequacies in [[synthesis]]
            -   as cited in #[[@booteScholarsResearchersCentrality2005]]

                -   a bit of a chicken-and-egg here maybe.. if [[Z: Effective synthesis is hard]] for everyone, then reviewers may not have adequate expertise to judge whether a [[synthesis]] is adequate. Probably doesn't change the numbers here that much though. and also remember that these aren't necessarily [[interdisciplinarity]] papers.
