        - Abstract
            - Insight problem solving is characterized by impasses, states of mind in which the thinker does not know what to do next. ==The authors hypothesized that impasses are broken by changing the problem representation, and 2 hypothetical mechanisms for representational change are described: the relaxation of constraints on the solution and the decomposition of perceptual chunks. These 2 mechanisms generate specific predictions about the relative difficulty of individual problems and about differential transfer effects.== The predictions were tested in 4 experiments using matchstick arithmetic problems. The results were consistent with the predictions. Representational change is a more powerful explanation for insight than alternative hypotheses, if the hypothesized change processes are specified in detail. Overcoming impasses in insight is a special case of the general need to override the imperatives of past experience in the face of novel conditions.

    - #lit-context
        - [[Stellan Ohlsson]] is prominent authority on [[Insight problem solving]]
        - Design: have people do two blocks: in second block people got a lot btter, so probably best to consider block 1 to really feel out the ffects of problem types
            - Vary problem difficulty by varying constraint hardness and chunk tightness, both together and independently
    - #[[📝 lit-notes]]
        - Two key mechanisms proposed for overcoming [[Impasses]] (aka [[fixation]], which is diagnosed as a suboptimal [[problem formulation]]): 1) [[constraint relaxation]], and [[chunk decomposition]]
            - If constraints are not considered explicitly, possible to over/under-constrain problem representation (through implicit reminding) (p. 1535)

                - Therefore, if problem solver is able to relax unnecessary constraints, they can find a problem representation that admits solution, and overcome the impasse
            - Argument for [[chunk decomposition]] as a mechanism of breaking [[fixation]] and [[Impasses]]
                - People create chunks to organize experience.
                - Encountering a novel problem activates some chunks from past experiences. Not all of them will be helpful; and some will be actively unhelpful. And some will need to be decomposed ([[compression]] reversed??)
                - Decomposing is harder for "tighter" chunks: where the components are not (obviously) meaningful units on their own
                - Thus, problems with tight chunks are harder to solve.
            - Evidence for this: when they made it harder to decompose chunks (even with identical constraint types), people were about half as likely to solve the problem (p. 1540).

                - Said another way
                    - Impeding [[chunk decomposition]] makes it harder to overcome [[Impasses]] during [[Insight problem solving]]

            - What are chunks??
                - "chunks" for Knoblich are *not* similar to [[Design Patterns]] or [[Frames]] - they are more like visual features, that exist at multiple levels of hierarachies. (cf.  
                - Knoblich characterizes [[Chunk]]s as #> "patterns that capture recurring constellations of features or components" (p. 1535)

                - To [[@chaseMindEyeChess1973]] on the idea of [[Chunking]] as a mechanism for expert performance #expertise
                    - Which itself goes back fruther to [[de Groot]], back in the mid-1960's
                    - Be careful, though! Their idea of [[Chunking]] is closer to the idea of [[compression]] - packing a huge amount of information into a smaller unit, abstracting away a lot of things.
        - Observed some transfer effects across blocks: once you see a constraint relaxed or decompose a chunk, a later problem that .
            - Somewhat anecdotal in Experiment 1, and directly validated in Experiment 2
