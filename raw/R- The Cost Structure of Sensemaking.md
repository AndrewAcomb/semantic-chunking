        - Introduces the [Learning Loop Complex] and idea of [encodon] as bridge between data and representations ([Schema]s)that are then used for downstream tasks during [sensemaking] (p. 271)

        - Also analyzes the [cost structure] of [sensemaking] and uses that to identify the most impactful ways to ease the process of sensemaking (in their case, it was data extraction)
            - They find that, for the cases they study, extracting data is the most costly step for [sensemaking] (p.273). 
                - This is very similar to the idea of the challenges to sastifying [[C- Composability facilitates synthesis]], and evokes the same feeling as what happens in [systematic review]s, as reported by [[R- Enslaved to the Trapped Data]]
