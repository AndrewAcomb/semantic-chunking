As a general rule for influencing behavior, [it is easier to facilitate people in doing something they already wanted to do but struggled with than it is to compel them to do something they did not want to do](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/behavioral-product-strategy). Many systems break down at the level of desire - if RDF already solves knowledge graph modeling questions, why hasn't the semantic web taken off? Many posit that RDF is awkward for people / developers to use.
