Waldo is a browser extension that amplifies Google search via advanced operators - scanning all keywords, images, and sentences on each webpage without having to open any links. [[C- Search terms express intentions]], and Waldo's search matches keywords and highlights as they appear in each sentence from the webpages found.

Waldo's unique benefit comes from search within Waldo's own search engine. Users can add on keywords within the search to hone the accuracy of what they are searching for [(2:20 mark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROf9Iixq7o)

Waldo is built almost as a DSL, affording users to improve their level of search depth as time goes on [[C- A DSL enables semantic self-expression]], and Waldo has [[C- Search terms should have smart defaults so people don't have to always use semantic self-expression|smart defaults so people don't have to always use semantic self-expression]].

[[P- Geoffrey Litt]]'s [[Twemex]] offers similar functionality as an override to Twitter's search. 

Waldo also offers on-demand research as a service, an interesting add-on to consider regarding [[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph|roles needed in a decentralized discourse graph]].

This informs [[I- Search as a primitive]], and may speak to the development of a new feature.
