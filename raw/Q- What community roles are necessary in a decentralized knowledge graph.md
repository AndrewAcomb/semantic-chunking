As discussed elsewhere, one of the most important questions to creating a decentralized discourse graph is the following: [[Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis]]? We also acknowledge that [[C- People are lazy]], so if we can split up the work of synthesis, we should.

If we were to divide up the work of synthesis by roles instead of jobs, below are some possible roles:
- Curator
	- Curates the fire hose of information down for people to keep up with the discourse in less effortful ways
- Connector
	- Consumes information across many domains and forms new connections, addressing the question of [[Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language]]
- Educator
	- Understands the discourse and educates others so they can more meaningfully participate. [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSdHmImyUjk) is a great example.
- New knowledge provider / creator
	- Contributes new information and beliefs to push the discourse forward. This may come from individuals or teams within the field doing novel research or reasoning, or from [idea brokers](https://publish.obsidian.md/joelchan-notes/discourse-graph/sources/%40hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997) bridging knowledge from one domain to another.
- Debater / contrarian
	- Makes sure people don't get too caught up in a consensus that is unsubstantiated.

This is one of our open questions going into [[Interview Guide|user interviews]]. #questions/core
