In  [[Notion]], you have many different views of the same underlying relational databases. You can edit or view them as Tables, Calendars, Boards, Lists, Galleries, and Gantt Charts. This means Notion provides multiple structural editors for relational databases.

[[TheBrain]] has a graphical and textual interface for navigating and editing your documents.
