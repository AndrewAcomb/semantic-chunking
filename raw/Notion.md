Notion is a block based DSL for file and relational database information entry and visualization.

The keywords and functions of Notion's language are executed through slash commands, which can essentially be thought of as autocomplete for common functions.

Notion has the ability to embed other websites directly into blocks. As an application, it does not need to do everything because it is interoperable with other web applications. Here we see that people are able to access their REPLs from Replit directly from within Notion.

In Notion, you have many different views of the same underlying relational databases. You can edit or view them as Tables, Calendars, Boards, Lists, Galleries, and Gantt Charts. This means Notion provides multiple structural editors for relational databases.
