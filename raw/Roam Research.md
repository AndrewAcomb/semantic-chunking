Roam Research is a prominently used networked tool for thought. Roam's early community connected many from the PKM, academic, and hacker spaces, who have built out an ecosystem of workflows and extensions alongside the platform. [[R- Roam can loosely be considered a DSL with a structural editor]] atop its Clojure base. 

Roam's aim is to augment collective intelligence over a long (50 years) time horizon, which has led to delays in desired user-facing updates. This has caused some early users to seek alternatives, and a spring of open source and alternative hypertext tools have arisen as competitors.
