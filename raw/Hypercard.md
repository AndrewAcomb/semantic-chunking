HyperCard is an example of early [[end-user programming]] in the wild. Released in 1987 by Apple on the Mac, HyperCard included its own [[DSL]] - HyperTalk - that enabled users to create hypermedia systems. HyperTalk was written in a syntax that resembled the English language, which enabled many non-programmers to interact with the cardstack structure expressed by HyperCard. 

HyperCard was deprecated in 2004. 

> The beauty of HyperCard is that it lets people program without having to learn how to write code â€” what I call "programming for the rest of us". HyperCard has made it possible for people to do things they wouldn't have ever thought of doing in the past without a lot of heavy-duty programming. It's let a lot of non-programmers, like me, into that loop.
