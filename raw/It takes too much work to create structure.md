In current tools, structuring ideas in real-time is an extraneous task that _takes you out of the flow of the work_ you're doing. Often, people don't even know how to predict how they will reuse the note in the future!

-   Deciding what to name something in the moment has a cost; people are removed from the current train of thought.
-   In a file-folder format, deciding where to place a note adds another layer of friction.
-   This occurs again when trying to retrieve past thoughts through search or block references.

For some experts, the primary concern is speed. As described in [[C- Synthesis is hard to do with people who donâ€™t share context with you]], experts prefer to work on their own or with people who already share context **because** their ability to move fast depends on omitting the basics.

Programmable notes, as described by [[P- Maggie Appleton]], [[P- Gordon Brander]], and myself in [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]], can enable people to create structure in bulk in hindsight, and create logical rules for structure from present inputs.
