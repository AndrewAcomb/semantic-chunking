Incremental formalization is a powerful design pattern for overcoming risks of formality, as described in [[R- Formality Considered Harmful]]. [[C- Synthesis tools need to support incremental formalization]]. Information is added in an informal fashion to begin, before formalizing once the task becomes clearer. [[C- Context is necessary for knowledge reuse]], but this is difficult before we understand the task at hand.

This is a similar approach to [[P- Tiago Forte]]'s progressive summarization.
