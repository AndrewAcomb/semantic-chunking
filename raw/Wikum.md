Wikum is a tool for rapidly organizing comments via recursive summarization in internet forums, affording a reader different views at the most important bits of information. 

Wikum aims to help readers see a summary tree of the main points of discussion. Because [[C- Compression facilitates synthesis]], a version of this could act as a [[primitive design]].
