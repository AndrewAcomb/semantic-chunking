        - Abstract
            - With the increasing ease and power of wmputer netsvorking technologies, many organisations me taking information which was previously managed and distributed on paper aud making it available electronically. Such shared information systems are the basis of much organisational collaboration, and electronic distribution holds great promise. However, a primary focus of such systems is on the ease of information retrieval. We believe that an equally important component is the problem of information interpretation, and that this interpretation is .@ded by a context which many electronic systems do not fully acknowledge.

            - In a case study of calendar systems, having metadata for event information such as the title of the event or arrival time of the speaker, in addition to who the author of the information is, were critical for the interpretation of the events.

                    - this is looking pretty good in terms of granularity, i can work with this!
                    - would be nice to know more about what is meant by interpretation of the events, but i can kind of get it from the snippet :) it's something about judgments of conflicts maybe? if there's more details to be had, do grab that too
