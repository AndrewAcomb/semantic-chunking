See [[R- Open Ideas]] as a starting point. Generally presents interesting ideas, but sort of handwaves away why people would cite each other and allocate a resource split to "social pressure." However, if ideas are represented as NFTs, for example, then you can see its history of transfers on chain.

Not sure if this is generally better than the [[Xanadu]] approach of trackable block references, as there would presumably be many copies, as opposed to a single thing being transferred between people.
