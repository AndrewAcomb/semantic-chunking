[[P- Chris Granger]]: If we do our job, my assumption is that the folks who are likely to change behavior will have more than enough incentive to do so in this system. The question is then how do we either provide some of the value for those that won't or create interesting dynamics that might get them there by accident.

[[P- Rob Haisfield]]: Right, I'm also pointing out that identifying concretely what those behaviors are is still important. In the very least, your behavioral statements during our conversation were good but generally abstract. I'll have more questions about it when I can see a UI. I have little doubt that people will want to use Jump on their own in excellent ways! I'm sure people will be itching to get their hands on dirty when they see more demos.
