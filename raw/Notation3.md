> The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for representing information in the Web.
> This document defines _Notation 3_ (also known as _N3_), an assertion and logic language which is a superset of RDF. N3 extends the RDF datamodel by adding formulae (literals which are graphs themselves), variables, logical implication, and functional predicates, as well as providing an textual syntax alternative to RDF/XML.
