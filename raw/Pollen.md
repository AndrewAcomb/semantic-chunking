Pollen is a domain-specific language written in Racket that lets you [tag information with functions](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/third-tutorial.html#%28part._.Tags___tag_functions%29). So, â—Šem{text} will apply a function that applies the "italicize" to "text" as an argument. For a basic overview, [see this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMz09jYOgoc).
