Airtable is database platform that enables [[end-user programming]] through its [[DSL]]. Airtable markets themselves as a low code editor for building collaborative apps, as many macros and functions are built in as design primitives. 

On the surface, Airtable looks like a spreadsheet, but built-in relational database features allow for greater scaling and advanced uses, including active app storage and maintenance.
