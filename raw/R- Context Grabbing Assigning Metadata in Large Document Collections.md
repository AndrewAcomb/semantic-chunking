        - Abstract
            - Classification schemes are an important issue in the collective use of large document collections. We have investigated the classification of technical documentations in two engineering domains: a steel mill and a sewerage plant company. In both cases we found a coexistence of different classification schemes and problems resulting from distributed local archives. In supporting human actors to maintain different classifications schemes while working on a common archive, we developed the concept of context grabbing. It allows assigning context information efficiently in the form of metadata. Based on a document management system, a tool kit for context grabbing was developed. Its evaluation in a sewerage service company allows us to comment on important aspects of understanding the role of classifications in collaborative work.

        - [[ECSCW]] is where a lot of the [[m/Ethnography]] in context of **Work** is still alive (exited somewhat from [[CSCW]]), so we can have a bit more confidence that this is done well from a theoretical and methodological perspective
        - last author [[Wendy Mackay]] is super-prominent in [[CSCW]]
            - ex: chosen to summarize history of social comptuing research in the 1980's at the 2020 CSCW conference panel

        - useful precursor to idea of [[flexible compression]] as means for tackling [[C- Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

        - **How did the authors approach their questions/problems?** ((most of this is going to come from the methods sections, although some info about conceptualization of key concepts might be relevant to pull from intro/lit-review)) #lit-context
        - **What did they find?** ((keep this as contextualized as possible; resist the urge to repeat claims or generalizations)) #[[observation-notes]]
            - Decentralized project documentation made recontextualization difficult for engineers because they didn't know the history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date, leading to issues such as "exploratory digging by hand" to avoid damaging power lines pg 375
                - [[P- Joel Chan]] comments
                    - this is looking pretty good in terms of granularity, i can work with this!
                    - would be nice to know more about what is meant by decentralized project documentation. 
                        - probably best to have a separate `observation note` block that summarizes that (with its own `context snippets`), and the block ref that into the "decentralized project documentation".
