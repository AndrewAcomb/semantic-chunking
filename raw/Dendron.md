Dendron is a networked hypertext tool for thought with a local-first, flexible hierarchy. 

> Dendron finds the usable center between unstructured backlinks and rigid file hierarchies. We help users maintain a canonical hierarchy for every note while also allowing for arbitrary backlinks to any other note.

This flexible data hierarchy aims to solve the growing problem of digital notebooks.
