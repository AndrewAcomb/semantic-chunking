WorldBrain's Memex is an open-source, privacy-focused browser extension to search, annotate, organize and share your online research.  

WorldBrain's Memex aims to eliminate time spent bookmarking, retracing steps to recall an old webpage, or copy-pasting notes into scattered documents.

Heavily inspired by Vannevar Bush's vision of a Memex.
