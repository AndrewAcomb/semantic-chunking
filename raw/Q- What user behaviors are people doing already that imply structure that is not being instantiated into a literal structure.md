This will be a primary research question of the interviews, as it is the sort of thing you need to see in action. User behavior will often reveal a structure that they did not know they had. For example, [people will use multiple colors to highlight sections of books](https://twitter.com/elzr/status/1373492338207698944?s=20), where the colors each mean something different. Roam is able to infer that the nesting and branching people do thoughtlessly as they write in outliners [is meaningful information for queries](https://twitter.com/elzr/status/1373492338207698944?s=20). People will use shorthand to communicate structure to themselves. How can we leverage what researchers and decision makers are already doing as they manage their knowledge?

[[Q- How can we form an implication graph for knowledge based on search and navigation behavior]]?

[[Q- How is knowledge crystallized and disseminated in discussion oriented explorer communities]]?

[[C- There is a wealth of creative exhaust generated by researchers that is going to waste]]
