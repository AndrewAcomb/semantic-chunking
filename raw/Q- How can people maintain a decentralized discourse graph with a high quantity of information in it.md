If everybody comments in the discourse graph, then comments become useless. If everybody produces content, then it's harder to find the right content.

As discussed on [[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]], curators and educators will play a valuable role in reducing the sheer quantity of information people need to keep up with.

Existing solutions like Twitter try to solve this problem through a newsfeed. However, [[C- Newsfeeds are a poor intervention for distributing and discovering relevant information]]. Hypertext is often better, but not the only solution.

Progressive summarization is one response to this as a way to [[C- It will be important to capture the potential energy of information consumption|capture potential energy of information consumption]].

[[C- An ideal decentralized discourse graph would enable people to view information at different levels of granularity through a ZUI]].

Alternatively, search operators could be helpful, such as a way to only view things between certain dates. See [[I- Search as a primitive]] for more discussion.
