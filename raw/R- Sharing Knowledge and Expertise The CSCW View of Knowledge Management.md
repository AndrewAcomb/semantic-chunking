        - In general, CSCW research on knowledge sharing has moved from a "repository model", which focused on externalizing knowledge in documents and databases, to an "expertise sharing" model, which focuses on helping people find relevant knowledge from other knowledgeable people directly  p.532-533

        - The shift from the "[repository model]" of CSCW work to focus on "[expertise sharing]" was stimulated in large part by rich discoveries about the large extent to which useful knowledge is tacit and situated [[tacit knowledge]] p.547

            - Cites [[R- Institutional Ecology Translations and Boundary Objects]] to note that [boundary object]s were a key learning from the first generation "repository models" to motivate the shift to [Expertise Sharing]

                - [boundary object]s derive part of their power (for facilitating cross-organizational/boundary coordination and work) by being "weakly structured in common use, and strongly structured in specific use"

            - #ClaimSecondary people tend to use the category with the lowest cognitive effort [[R- Down in the (Data)base(ment)]]

                - [[R- Down in the (Data)base(ment)]] call these "residual categories"
                - it can be quite hard to standardize (and therefore make efficient) expressions of [context] (e.g., in a dropdown menu of possible "contexts")
