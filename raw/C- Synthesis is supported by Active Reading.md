##### Work in Progress
#WIP

Active reading is quite old and established/mature, spans the Education literature as well as [HCI].
        - [active reading] is also another thing to add to the claim that [[C- People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]
    - R-Sources
        - [[R- LiquidText A Flexible Multitouch Environment to Support Active Reading]] is a decent entry point into the [active reading] literature
            - the [[LiquidText]] system in particular is nicely grounded in [[R- Active reading and its discontents]], which is a nice formative study of active reading with interviews and [Participatory Design] workshops
        - another decent one is [[R- Beyond paper supporting active reading with free form digital ink annotations]], which cites [[R- A diary study of work-related reading design implications for digital reading devices]] as a #canonical ref for [active reading]


[[C- Curation is an important role in maintaining a decentralized discourse graph]]. [[C- It will be important to capture the potential energy of information consumption]].
