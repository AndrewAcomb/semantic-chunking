Operating System concept design inspired by [[Roam Research]] and [[Muse]]. Semilattice can be seen as a series of interactions and systemic concepts on top of personal knowledge management (PKM) tools. The system is block-based, with a card structure that consists of multiple lists of blocks and drawings. Each block and card can have a networked relationship, and can have multiple parents and children.

Semilattice is designed to improve information processing in existing PKM tools, specifically web-based research problems.
