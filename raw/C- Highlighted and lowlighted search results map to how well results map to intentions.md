What if the choice architecture for interacting with search results allowed you to indicate the strength of the links and how well it maps to your intended outcome? Maybe upvoting and downvoting results. Or collapsing, or clicking. [[C- User behavior within a well-designed choice architecture can be a signal of preferences]] This would allow people to weight connections.

If [[C- Search terms express intentions]], then highlighted (emphasized) and lowlighted (de-emphasized) results show how well the search matches the intention. [[Knovigator]] allows people to use quadratic voting on each block in order to indicate how important or relevant it is.

Look at this search. A good amount of the results are irrelevant to my current query. I should be able to remove results and move them to the top.
