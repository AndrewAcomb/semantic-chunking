Extensible Data Notation (EDN) is a subset of the syntax in Clojure, similar to JSON. This allows for richer backend data structures alongside Datomic, and represents the data structures as text. 

EDN is extensible, which neither JSON or YAML can say. This enables text to act as functions to transform the data, similar to a map function.
