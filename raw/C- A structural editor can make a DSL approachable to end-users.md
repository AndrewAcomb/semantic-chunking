Text does not need to be people's interface for editing code. Structural editors like Fructure can make it impossible to write code that doesn't work. Based on the function you are writing, it will suggest valid arguments to you. Advanced, context-aware autocomplete can perform the same job.

Spreadsheets make CSVs more approachable. Airtable makes relational databases approachable. The issue with text on its own is often that it requires users to memorize a syntax, and that scares people.
