A Zoomable User Interface, or ZUI, affords different views and layers to explore within a tool. 

Examples: 
This can be seen in the form of:
- graph views (like in [[Obsidian|Obsidian]]),
- multiple layers of description (like [[Kosmik]]), or
- foldable comment summaries (like in [[Wikum|Wikum]])
- Many examples here: https://twitter.com/MatthewWSiu/status/1228155105683263490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw
