This video gives a basic intro to TheBrain. It has a graphical and textual interface for navigating and editing your documents.

Within the graphical interface, it occasionally uses a DSL. For example, creating many branching nodes is similar to writing out the cells of a csv, except you separate nodes with a semicolon.

For a comparison with [[Roam Research]], see the following video from [[P- Matt Goldenberg]].
