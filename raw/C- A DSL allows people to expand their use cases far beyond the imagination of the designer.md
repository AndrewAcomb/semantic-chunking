[[C- A DSL allows for abstraction]]. 

[[C- End-user programming enables the developers to be lazy about their backlog of feature requests]]. 

We see this in communities like [[Roam Research]] and [[Obsidian]], where members design new add-ons and build the ecosystem of the product, picking off most of the low-hanging fruit from the product's current version. This also enables development teams to focus on their own areas of expertise, leaving other work for interested community developers.
