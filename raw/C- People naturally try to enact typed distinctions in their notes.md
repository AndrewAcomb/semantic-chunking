- Let's start with articulating some desire paths we've observed. I'll focus on Roam first because this is what the [[Discourse Graph Plugin]] hooks into, but we can also generalize to other settings.
    - In [[Roam Research]]
        - [[@ Maggie Appleton]]'s evergreen note system: https://maggieappleton.com/roam-garden
            - Loom

            - Maggie prefixes evergreen note titles with * to enable her to Efficiently retrieve high-signal conceptual building blocks for synthesis and writing
            - Some notes are tagged in-line as "seedlings" to guide attention (needs more work). These "seedlings" are integrated with a "writing inbox" practice adapted from Andy. This enables her to Incrementally develop ideas over time
            - She enhances this by applying CSS styles to enable visual distinction. This is a very common practice in the Roam (and larger hypertext notebook community; see, e.g., [[Obsidian]] supercharged links plugin: https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links): https://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam
            - Note: Maggie's [[Zettelkasten]] system is a synthesis with [[Evergreen Notes]]

- Observations
    - Typing unlocks affordances that people find useful for their knowledge work. A shortlist includes the following:
        - Incrementally develop ideas over time
        - Efficiently retrieve high-signal conceptual building blocks for synthesis and writing
        - Trace provenance of ideas to high-signal types of sources, including one's own thought context, and references/literature
    - There are pretty good workarounds and techniques for specifying types of nodes. 
    - There is significant diversity in the specific language used for the terms, including wholesale differences in metaphors
    -  Specifying types of relationships remains clunky. 
        - This is where the [[Discourse Graph Plugin]] enhances things.
