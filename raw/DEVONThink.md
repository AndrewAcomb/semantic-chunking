DEVONthink is a networked tool for thought on Mac that allows users to collect and organize their documents while affording annotation across any document type. An interesting affordance is an automated categorization system that is trained by past user behavior.   

> DEVONthink keeps all your documents in easy-to-backup databases and presents them to you in a variety of ways. Many documents can be viewed and edited without opening them in another application. Read web pages as if they were local documents.
> [DEVONthink Pro](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions) scans paper documents and makes them searchable, imports email, and even downloads complete web sites.
