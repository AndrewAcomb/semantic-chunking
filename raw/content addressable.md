Refers to conditions when a structure can be modified, as discussed in the possibility of a [[I- A structural editor for data structures]]. An important piece is the content retaining the same identity while being addressed in a specific state. 

You can see examples of this in the block-based nature of [[Roam Research|Roam]]'s [[primitive design]]. Each block has its own stable ID that can be, and comments or additional indented blocks can exist as their own IDs. The original block can always be referenced by the initial ID, no matter the variations that come later.
