> The Discourse Graph extension enables [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) users to seamlessly add additional semantic structure to their notes, including specified page types and link types that [model scientific discourse](/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/fundamentals/what-is-a-discourse-graph), to enable more complex and structured [knowledge synthesis work](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/3), such as a complex interdisciplinary literature review, and enhanced collaboration with others on this work.

For more details, see the [documentation](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/) and a [demo](https://www.loom.com/share/2ec80422301c451b888b65ee1d283b40).
